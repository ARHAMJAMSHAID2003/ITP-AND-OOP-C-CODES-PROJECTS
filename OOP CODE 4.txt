//Define the class Polynomial that simulates a polynomial of the form f(x) = ax2 +bx+c. The class should
//contain:
//(a) The default constructor that initializes the coefficients of the polynomial, that is, a, b, and c to 1.
//The coefficients should be private members and assume that they are integers.
//(b) A constructor that initializes the coefficients of the polynomial with given values.
//(c) The format() function that returns a string containing the polynomial in the form ax^2 + bx + c.
//(d) The eval(int x) function that returns the result of evaluating the polynomial at x.
//(e) An overloaded function of the + operator, so that additions may be performed between polynomials
//e.g., r=p + q ). That is, the function should return a polynomial with coefficients the sum of the
//coefficients of p and q.
//(f) An overloaded function of the [] operator, so that we can assign new values to the coefficients of
//the polynomial The signature of the function should be int& operator[](int index) which returns a
//reference to the coefficient of the polynomial at the given index.
//E.g., with the statement poly[0] = 3 the coefficient a of the poly object should become 3, while with
//the statement poly[1] = 10 the coefficient b should become 10.
//If the value of the index is not valid, that is, it is not 0, |1|, or |2|, the program should terminate.
//(You can use the exit() function from <cstdlib> to terminate the program.)
//(g) An overloaded function of the == operator, so that we can check if two polynomials are equal, that
//is, if their respective coefficients are equal.
//Write a program that tests the functionality of the Polynomial class.
