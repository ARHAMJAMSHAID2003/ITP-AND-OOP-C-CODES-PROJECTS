//Define the Book class with private members the title of the book, its code, and its price. It should also
//contain the following public functions:
//• void review(float grd) which grades the book with the grade grd. The review() can be called
//multiple times for the same book. The final score is the average of the grades.
//• a constructor that accepts as parameters the data of the book and assigns them to the corresponding
//members of the object.
//Add to the class any other function or member you think is needed.
//The following test program declares an array of five objects of type Book and initializes it. It calls the
//review() of the objects few times. Then, the program read the code of a book from user and, if the book
//exists, the program display its score and price. If the book does not exist or it exists but has not been
//graded, the program display a related message.
